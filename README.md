This project focuses on building an effective image classification system using the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains grayscale images of various clothing items. It implements three different machine learning models—Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)—to analyze and classify the data. The dataset undergoes thorough preprocessing including normalization, reshaping, augmentation, and stratified train-test splitting. While SVM and Random Forest work on flattened image data, the CNN leverages spatial hierarchies through convolutional layers. To enhance overall performance, the predictions from all three models are combined using a soft voting ensemble approach. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score demonstrate that the ensemble model outperforms individual classifiers, achieving the highest accuracy of 91.21%. The results highlight the strength of combining deep learning with traditional machine learning methods for improved robustness and classification accuracy.
